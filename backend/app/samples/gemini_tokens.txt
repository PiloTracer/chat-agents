It's great that you've integrated Gemini! Let's break down that error: LLM request failed: gemini returned empty text (finish=MAX_TOKENS) .

This error message is very specific and gives us a clear indication of what's happening:

gemini returned empty text : This means the model didn't generate any content for the output.
(finish=MAX_TOKENS) : This is the crucial part. It indicates that the model stopped generating text because it hit the max_output_tokens limit you set before it could finish its response. When it hits this limit, it essentially truncates its output, and in many cases, this can result in an empty or incomplete response if the model didn't even get to produce the first full token of meaningful output.
Let's address the potential causes and your settings:

Analysis of Your Current Setup:
LLM request failed: gemini returned empty text (finish=MAX_TOKENS) :
Primary Suspect: Your GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS setting (or CHAT_MAX_TOKENS if that's what's being used for Gemini) is likely too low for the complexity or length of the response Gemini is trying to generate.
Other Possibilities (Less Likely given MAX_TOKENS ):
Instruction Clarity: If the prompt is very vague or asks for something extremely short and the max_output_tokens is set to something like 1, it could trigger this.
Safety Filters: While less common to result in MAX_TOKENS finish reason, if a response is filtered entirely, it might appear as empty text. However, usually, a finish_reason=SAFETY would be explicitly returned.
using model: gemini-2.5-pro :
Correction/Clarification: As of my last update, a publicly available model named gemini-2.5-pro is not standard on Vertex AI or the Generative Language API. The current high-end model is Gemini 1.5 Pro . It's possible you're referring to an internal model name or a misunderstanding.
Why this matters: If you're using a model name that doesn't exist, the API call should fail with a 404 Not Found error (which you previously experienced and hopefully resolved by using gemini-1.5-pro or a specific version like gemini-1.5-pro-001 ). If it's accepting gemini-2.5-pro but giving you an empty response, it might be defaulting to a different model or having issues with that specific identifier.
Please double-check: The correct model name for the 1 million token context model on Vertex AI is gemini-1.5-pro (or a specific version like gemini-1.5-pro-001 ).
GEMINI_API_KEY=[i'm using an old api key from a long time ago, it shuold work] :
Generative Language API vs. Vertex AI: This is a critical distinction.
The URL https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta indicates you are using the Generative Language API (often referred to as gemini-pro without a project/location in the URL).
The code I provided earlier was designed for Vertex AI , which uses project IDs, locations, and service accounts for authentication ( google.cloud.aiplatform ).
API Keys are primarily for the Generative Language API (which gives you access to gemini-pro models directly, not typically gemini-1.5-pro ).
Vertex AI typically uses Google Cloud IAM (service accounts or user credentials via gcloud auth ).
Problem: If you are trying to access gemini-1.5-pro (which is a Vertex AI model) using an API_KEY and the generativelanguage.googleapis.com endpoint, it will likely not work as expected . Gemini 1.5 Pro (with its 1M token context, context caching, etc.) is primarily offered through Vertex AI , which requires different authentication and a different API endpoint structure ( {LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com ).
GEMINI_ENABLE_CONTEXT_CACHE=true :
Context Caching and API: Explicit context caching (as implemented in the code I provided with aiplatform.gapic.CachedContentService ) is a feature of Vertex AI's Gemini 1.5 Pro . If you're using the Generative Language API (with generativelanguage.googleapis.com and an API key), this advanced context caching feature is not directly available in the same way. The Generative Language API offers simpler models and might have less advanced features for extreme context management.
Recommended Steps to Fix:
Based on the error and your settings, here's what I recommend:

Option 1: Switch to Vertex AI (Recommended for Gemini 1.5 Pro and large contexts)

This is the path I initially provided code for, as it's the native way to access Gemini 1.5 Pro and its advanced features like context caching.

Verify Model Name: Ensure your GEMINI_CHAT_MODEL is gemini-1.5-pro or a specific version like gemini-1.5-pro-001 , which is available in your GCP_LOCATION . Use the list_generative_models script I provided to confirm.
Authentication:
Remove GEMINI_API_KEY from your .env for Vertex AI usage.
Ensure your application is authenticated to Google Cloud using IAM. For local development, this means running gcloud auth application-default login . For deployment, use a service account with the Vertex AI User role.


Endpoint: Ensure your code is using the Vertex AI endpoint structure:
# In GeminiLLMProvider __init__:
self.client = aiplatform.gapic.PredictionServiceClient(
    client_options={"api_endpoint": f"{self.location}-aiplatform.googleapis.com"}
)
self.endpoint = f"projects/{self.project_id}/locations/{self.location}/publishers/google/models/{self.model_name}"



This is what the code I provided does. If you've modified it to use GEMINI_API_BASE directly, you need to revert that for Vertex AI.

Increase MAX_TOKENS :
Set GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS in your .env to a higher value. For Gemini 1.5 Pro, the maximum output tokens can go up to 8192 . Try setting it to 8192 to see if that resolves the empty text (finish=MAX_TOKENS) error. If the response is still too long for that, you might need to reconsider your prompt or processing.

GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS=8192 # Increase this value significantly


Re-enable Context Caching: If you successfully switch to Vertex AI, the _handle_large_context_with_caching logic in the provided code will start working as intended for explicit CachedContent management.
Option 2: Continue with Generative Language API (if gemini-pro is sufficient)

If you intend to use the simpler Generative Language API with an API key, then:

Model Name: You will likely need to use gemini-pro (or gemini-pro-vision for multimodal). gemini-1.5-pro is generally not available through this API. So, gemini-2.5-pro definitely won't work.

GEMINI_CHAT_MODEL=gemini-pro # Use the correct model for Generative Language API

Endpoint: Ensure your GEMINI_API_BASE is https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta .
Authentication: Use your GEMINI_API_KEY .
MAX_TOKENS : Increase your GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS . The gemini-pro model typically has a smaller max_output_tokens limit than gemini-1.5-pro (often around 2048 or 4096). You'll need to check the specific limits for gemini-pro .
Context Caching: The explicit CachedContent feature from Vertex AI will not be available here. You would need to manage context yourself by including the full history in each prompt, which can become costly and hit context limits faster.

The empty text (finish=MAX_TOKENS) error is almost certainly due to the max_output_tokens being too low. However, the mention of GEMINI_API_KEY and generativelanguage.googleapis.com strongly suggests a mismatch between your desired model ( gemini-1.5-pro for 1M context and caching) and the API you're actually calling.

My strongest recommendation is to ensure you are fully configured to use Vertex AI for Gemini 1.5 Pro , as this is where the 1 million token context and advanced caching features reside. Follow the steps under Option 1 .
