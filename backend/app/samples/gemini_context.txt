Okay, coding assistant, let's diagnose and fix this LLM request failed: gemini returned empty text (finish=MAX_TOKENS) error with gemini-flash-latest .

This error is a very strong indicator that the model is stopping its generation because it has hit the maximum output token limit you've set, before it could produce any meaningful text. The fact that a simple "give me a very short summary" worked, but "deme un corto resumen de la demanda" (which implies a context to summarize) failed, points to two main areas:

1. The MAX_TOKENS Limit is Still Too Low
Even for gemini-1.5-flash (which gemini-flash-latest typically maps to), the max_output_tokens setting is crucial. While gemini-1.5-flash is faster and cheaper, its maximum output token limit is still quite generous, typically 8192 tokens , just like gemini-1.5-pro .

Explanation for you:
When the model receives a request to summarize something, it first processes the input context. Then, it starts generating the summary. If your GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS (or CHAT_MAX_TOKENS if that's what's being used for Gemini) is set to a very small number (e.g., 256, 512, 1024), the model might hit this limit before it even completes the first sentence or paragraph of the summary, resulting in an empty or truncated response.

Action for you:
Increase GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS in your .env file to the model's maximum capacity.


# ... other settings ...
GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS=8192 # Set this to the maximum allowed for gemini-1.5-flash
# ...



After this change, restart your application to ensure the new environment variable is loaded.

2. Correct Context Provision for Gemini
You mentioned you have "extracted text from 8 different documents, and chunked it out into the database" and that "These chunks are used to provide context to the other models with no issue." This is excellent, but we need to ensure this context is being correctly passed to Gemini.

Explanation for you:
The LLM (Gemini in this case) doesn't inherently know about your database or the documents you've processed. For it to summarize a "demanda" (demand), the actual text of that demand (or the relevant chunks from your RAG system) must be explicitly included in the API request to Gemini .

My provided GeminiLLMProvider class has a large_context_text parameter specifically for this purpose. When you call generate_content , you need to pass the retrieved document chunks into this parameter.

Action for you:
Verify how you are calling the generate_content method when you send the prompt "deme un corto resumen de la demanda."

You need to ensure that:

You are retrieving the relevant document chunks from your database based on the user's query ("demanda").
You are passing these retrieved chunks as the large_context_text argument to the gemini_provider.generate_content method.
You are also providing a full_context_id if you want to leverage the explicit Vertex AI CachedContent feature for cost optimization on repeated contexts.
Example of how the call should look (assuming retrieved_chunks_text contains the relevant document content):




# In your application logic, after retrieving relevant chunks:
retrieved_chunks_text = "..." # This should be the concatenated text from your RAG system
context_identifier = "user_session_123_demand_summary" # A unique ID for this context

messages_for_gemini = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "deme un corto resumen de la demanda."}
]

response = gemini_provider.generate_content(
    messages=messages_for_gemini,
    large_context_text=retrieved_chunks_text,
    full_context_id=context_identifier
)




Summary of Corrections:
Increase GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS to 8192 in your .env file.
Ensure you are passing the retrieved document chunks into the large_context_text parameter of the generate_content method when you want Gemini to summarize them.
After making these changes, the MAX_TOKENS error should be resolved, and Gemini should be able to process and summarize your provided context.
